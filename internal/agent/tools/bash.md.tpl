Execute shell commands; long-running commands automatically move to background and return a shell ID.

<environment>
Runs on macOS via `bash -lc` using the system shell. The BSD coreutils and
standard POSIX toolset are available. Use forward slashes for paths.
</environment>

<execution_steps>
1. Directory Verification: If creating directories/files, use LS tool to verify parent exists
2. Security Check: Banned commands ({{ .BannedCommands }}) return error - explain to user. Safe read-only commands execute without prompts
3. Command Execution: Execute with proper quoting, capture output
4. Auto-Background: Commands exceeding 1 minute (default, configurable via `auto_background_after`) automatically move to background and return shell ID
5. Output Processing: Truncate if exceeds {{ .MaxOutputLength }} characters
6. Return Result: Include errors, metadata with <cwd></cwd> tags
</execution_steps>

<usage_notes>
- Command required, working_dir optional (defaults to current directory)
- IMPORTANT: Use Grep/Glob/Agent tools instead of 'find'/'grep'. Use Read/LS tools instead of 'cat'/'head'/'tail'/'ls'
- Chain with ';' or '&&', avoid newlines except in quoted strings
- Each command runs in independent shell (no state persistence between calls)
- Prefer absolute paths over 'cd' (use 'cd' only if user explicitly requests)
{{- if .RgAvailable }}
- Ripgrep (`rg`) is available; prefer it over `grep` for faster, more intuitive searching
{{- end }}
</usage_notes>

<background_execution>
- Set run_in_background=true to run commands in a separate background shell
- Returns a shell ID for managing the background process
- Use job_output tool to view current output from background shell
- Use job_kill tool to terminate a background shell
- IMPORTANT: NEVER use `&` at the end of commands to run in background - use run_in_background parameter instead
- Commands that should run in background:
  * Long-running servers (e.g., `npm start`, `python -m http.server`, `node server.js`)
  * Watch/monitoring tasks (e.g., `npm run watch`, `tail -f logfile`)
  * Continuous processes that don't exit on their own
  * Any command expected to run indefinitely
- Commands that should NOT run in background:
  * Build commands (e.g., `npm run build`, `go build`)
  * Test suites (e.g., `npm test`, `pytest`)
  * Git operations
  * File operations
  * Short-lived scripts
</background_execution>

<git_message_quality>
These rules apply whenever creating or updating commit messages, PR titles, or PR bodies:

- Messages MUST be understandable to someone unfamiliar with the codebase.
- Before creating or updating a message, verify this litmus test: a new contributor reading only the commit message or PR title/body should understand what problem this solves, why it matters, and the impact without opening files, reading the diff, or knowing internal code names.
- Avoid code identifiers, filenames, function names, and implementation details unless they are necessary for understanding the user-facing impact.
</git_message_quality>

<commit_messages>
Commit messages are for future readers scanning history. Before committing:

- Follow <git_message_quality>.
- Draft a concise 1-2 sentence message focusing on why the change exists and what outcome it enables, not a list of files or implementation details.
- Use clear, accurate verbs and avoid generic messages.
- The first line MUST be under 72 characters.
- Add a body only when needed to explain reasoning, tradeoffs, or important context; wrap body lines at 72 characters.

Good: pytest /foo/bar/tests
Bad: cd /foo/bar && pytest tests
